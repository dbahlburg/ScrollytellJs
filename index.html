        <p><h2>Antarctic krill or Euphausia superba is a small crustacean of enormous importance to the ecosystem of the
          Southern Ocean. Even though the word krill is often associated with Antarctic krill which only occurs in Antarctica,
          there are a total of 31 different krill species which inhabit the oceans worldwide. However, none of the other 30
          species comes close to Antarctic krill in terms of abundance and importance to the regional ecosystem. With a total
          estimated biomass of up to 379 Million tonnes, Antarctic krill not only dominates the Southern Ocean ecosystem but
          is also considered one of the biomass-richest species on earth with its closest competitors being cattle and humans. <br>
          Due to this enormous abundance, Antarctic krill is an important prey item for many Southern Ocean predators such
          as crabeater seals, multiple species of penguins or even humpback, blue and fin whales. These close linkages between
          the crustaceans and its pursuers makes it an influential species in numerous ways. In a study from 2007, Dr. Jefferson
          Hinke (NOAA) and colleagues showed that annual fluctuations in krill abundance can be a main driver of penguin breeding
          success around the South Shetland islands which are one of the krill hotspots in the Southern Ocean.

    of Antarctic krill. As a consequence, the population dynamics of both species are tightly coupled with regional
  population dynamics of Antarctic krill. Photos: Dominik Bahlburg</figcaption>

  <p><h2>
    In another example, researchers continue to explore the “krill-surplus-hypothesis” which aims to explain increased
    penguins abundances during the 1970s and decreasing populations sizes from there on. According to the hypothesis,
    the strong reduction in Antarctic whale and seal populations caused by commercial harvesting until the 1970s
    reduced the feeding pressure of those predators on regional krill populations. This food surplus enabled penguins,
    which in contrast were not commercially harvested, to grow in population size during these times. With the ongoing
    recovery of whale and seal populations, competition for krill among its predators increases and penguin populations
    start to drop. <br>
    Both examples demonstrate how krill can directly and indirectly drive population dynamics of other species in a complex
    network of trophic relationships.

            <p><h2><strong>Birth</strong> <br>The life of Antarctic krill starts as an <strong>egg</strong> of a diameter of 0.6mm. Usually, females spawn in deep waters where the depth exceeds 1000m. After release, the eggs sink down the water column at a rate of around 100-200m per day. Scientists believe that krill prefer these deep water spawning grounds in order to avoid eggs reaching the sea floor before hatching occurs.
              During this descent, the embryo undergoes multiple cell divisions until it develops into a <strong>nauplius larva</strong> and hatches after approximately 6 days. </h2></p>
            </div>
            <div id="div2" class = 'stageNoTitle'>
              <p>  <h2><strong>Nauplius I and II</strong> <br>The nauplius stage is a developmental stage shared by most marine crustaceans. Therefore, it is not unique to Antarctic krill but can also be found in the life cycles of lobsters, barnacles or copepods. As the first <strong>free-swimming</strong> stage, the nauplii of Antarctic krill start ascending in the water column until they reach depths of approximately 200m.
                The nauplius stage consists of the <strong>nauplius I and II </strong>substages. Nauplii are characterized by their oval body shape, their appendages and a <span class = 'redText'> rudimentary eye</span>. It takes the krill around 9 days to develop through the nauplius stages until the <strong>metanauplius</strong> stage is reached.</h2>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="div4" class = 'stageNoTitle'>
              <p><h2><strong>Metanauplius</strong> <br>During the metanauplius stage, krill starts developing its <span class = 'redText'>carapace</span>.
                The carapace is the “main shield” of the <strong>exoskeleton</strong>, an armour-like shell which surrounds the small crustaceans.
                Krill grow by <strong>molting</strong> which means that the exoskeleton is regularly casted off and replaced by a new one.
                This also enables individuals to make sudden morphological leaps during larval development.</h2></p>
              </div>
              <div id="div6" class = 'stageNoTitle'>
                <p>  <h2><strong>Calyptotis I</strong> <br> After 13 days, krill reaches the calyptotis stage.
                  During the calyptotis stage, most notably the <strong>abdomen</strong> starts to <strong>elongate</strong> which leads to the characteristic long body shape which krill keep for the rest of their lives.
                  In addition, the stalked <span class = 'redText'>compound eyes</span> are clearly visible now. This is also the first stage where krill <strong>actively feeds</strong> since the mouth parts are now formed and functioning.</h2></p>
                </div>
                <div id="div8" class = 'stageNoTitle'>
                  <p><h2><strong>Calyptotis III</strong> <br> In the third and final calyptotis stage, the abdomen is clearly segmented and the compound eyes well
                    developed. At this stage, the body is also partially covered by <span class = 'redText'>red pigments</span> which will later be responsible for the red colour of adult krill.
                    The star-shaped pigments are <strong>retractable</strong> and depending on their expansion, the colour of individuals can change from almost translucent to intense red.
                    At this point of their development, the krill have reached a size of around 3mm.</h2></p>
                  </div>
                  <div id="div10" class = 'stageNoTitle'>
                    <p>  <h2><strong>Furcilia</strong> <br> Furcilia larvae already strongly resemble juvenile krill but are much smaller with a maximum size of 11mm in their sixth and final substage.
                      While going through the furcilia stage, the eyes start to <strong>extend out of the carapace</strong>, the legs and mouth parts fully developed and most importantly, the <strong>feeding basket</strong> is now present.
                      The feeding basket is formed by a number of front legs with very fine appendages. Through rhythmic movements of those legs, krill filter the surrounding water with astonishing efficiency.
                      They are able to retain almost <strong>100%</strong> of particles down to sizes as low as <strong>1 &#956m</strong>. </h2></p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="div12" class = 'stageNoTitle'>
                      <p>  <h2><strong>Adult</strong> <br>
                        2 years after hatching, krill finally reach the adult stage. As adults they grow to a maximum size of <strong>60mm</strong>.
                        In contrast to the juvenile stage which comes in between furcilia and adults, the <strong>reproduction organs</strong> are now differentiated and
                        functional. Krill usually start reproducing in their second year of life and do so <strong>annually</strong> until they reach their expected life
                        span of 6 years.

                <div class="mainTextDiv">
                  <p><h2>Antarctic krill or Euphausia superba is a small crustacean of enormous importance to the ecosystem of the
                    Southern Ocean. Even though the word krill is often associated with Antarctic krill which only occurs in Antarctica,
                    there are a total of 31 different krill species which inhabit the oceans worldwide. However, none of the other 30
                    species comes close to Antarctic krill in terms of abundance and importance to the regional ecosystem. With a total
                    estimated biomass of up to 379 Million tonnes, Antarctic krill not only dominates the Southern Ocean ecosystem but
                    is also considered one of the biomass-richest species on earth with its closest competitors being cattle and humans. <br>
                    Due to this enormous abundance, Antarctic krill is an important prey item for many Southern Ocean predators such
                    as crabeater seals, multiple species of penguins or even humpback, blue and fin whales. These close linkages between
                    the crustaceans and its pursuers makes it an influential species in numerous ways. In a study from 2007, Dr. Jefferson
                    Hinke (NOAA) and colleagues showed that annual fluctuations in krill abundance can be a main driver of penguin breeding
                    success around the South Shetland islands which are one of the krill hotspots in the Southern Ocean.

              In another example, researchers continue to explore the “krill-surplus-hypothesis” which aims to explain increased
              penguins abundances during the 1970s and decreasing populations sizes from there on. According to the hypothesis,
              the strong reduction in Antarctic whale and seal populations caused by commercial harvesting until the 1970s
              reduced the feeding pressure of those predators on regional krill populations. This food surplus enabled penguins,
              which in contrast were not commercially harvested, to grow in population size during these times. With the ongoing
              recovery of whale and seal populations, competition for krill among its predators increases and penguin populations
              start to drop. <br>
              Both examples demonstrate how krill can directly and indirectly drive population dynamics of other species in a complex
              network of trophic relationships.

                <p><strong>The Southern Ocean</strong> <br>The Southern Ocean surrounds the Antarctic continent and is composed of sectors of the <strong>Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Ocean</strong>.
                It is an Ocean with extreme <strong>seasonality</strong> which makes it an especially challenging home for its inhabitants.</p>

                  <p><strong>Thermal isolation</strong> <br>The Southern Ocean is different to other oceans in that it is very isolated. Its water masses
                  are typically cold, in some areas less than -2°C. The extend of the Southern Ocean is broadly defined by the Southern Polar Convergence
                which describes the edge area where cold Antarctic water masses meet warmer Subantarctic waters. The result is distinctive sharp latitudinal temperature gradient.</p>

                  <p> <strong>The Antarctic Circumpolar Current</strong> <br>One of the most important contributing factors driving the isolation of the Southern Ocean is the
                  <strong>Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC)</strong>. The ACC is a wind-driven current and one of the strongest on earth with flow rates of up to 4 km/h (or 35'000 km per year).
                  It constantly transports water around Antarctica in a clockwise direction and prevents the mixing of Antarctic and more northerly surface waters.</p>

                  <p> The ACC not only contributes to the separation of water masses but also acts as a "highway" around Antarctica. Particles trapped in the ACC can
                    travel as far as 17'000 kilometers in only three years as shown in the map.
                    Adult krill are usually not considered as passive drifters but researchers discuss the role of the ACC in connecting different krill populations
